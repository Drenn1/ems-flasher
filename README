The EMS flasher is a simple command line flasher for the 64 Mbit EMS USB
flash cart for Game Boy.

BUILDING

make

On Mac, prior to building you must install pkgconfig and libusb from
ports, like so:

sudo port install pkgconfig
sudo port install libusb

(thanks to hyarion for this info)

RUNNING

./ems totally_legit_rom.gb

This will flash the ROM file to the first bank on the cart.

BEWARE: if you give it a huge file on input, it will continue writing
past the end of the cart and do unknown amounts of damage. Please don't
do this!
