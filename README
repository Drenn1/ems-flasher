The EMS flasher is a simple command line flasher for the 64 Mbit EMS USB
flash cart for Game Boy.

BUILDING

make

On Mac, prior to building you must install pkgconfig and libusb from
ports, like so:

sudo port install pkgconfig
sudo port install libusb

(thanks to hyarion for this info)

RUNNING

The software has three major modes of operation:

 * write ROM to cart
 * read ROM from cart
 * read title of ROM on cart

To write use --write, to read use --read, and to get the title use
--title.

Write mode will write the ROM specified on the command line to bank 1 on
the cart. Read mode will read the entirety of bank 1 (32 megabits / 4
megabytes) into the ROM file specified.

Title mode does not require a file argument, and will print the ROM
title to stdout.

BEWARE: if you give the EMS flasher a huge file for writing, it will
continue writing past the end of the cart and do unknown amounts of
damage. Please don't do this!

Additionally, all modes take a --verbose flag for giving more output.
You can also adjust the block size, but it is recommended you leave this
to the default of 4096 bytes for writing and 32 bytes for reading (used
by the Windows software).

For a full list of options, run the command with the --help flag.

MULTIROM SUPPORT

The options "--add", "--delete", and "--list" handle multirom support. See 
examples for usage.

EXAMPLES

# write the ROM to the cart
./ems-flasher --write totally_legit_rom.gb

# saves the contents of the cart into the file; print some extra info
./ems-flasher --verbose --read not_warez.gb

# print out the title
./ems-flasher --title

MULTIROM EXAMPLES

# Setup the bank for gameboy [color] mode
./ems-flasher --write menu.gb[c]

# Add a rom to the bank
./ems-flasher --add totally_legit_rom.gb

# Remove the first rom from the bank
./ems-flasher --delete 2
